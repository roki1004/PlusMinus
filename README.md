# PlusMinus
Unity Project PlusMinus 

"This project began with the intention of creating a puzzle game that is easy for players to learn but requires continuous thinking. The game involves combining colors of the same type and subtracting colors of different types to achieve a specific target number.

This space is where the script for the game is uploaded."
